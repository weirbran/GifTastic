# GifTastic

### Overview

This is the sixth assignment for the Coding Bootcamp delivereed at University of Toronto Mississauga.

In this assignment, we were required to create a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of our choice. It required us to call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of our site.

### Description 

When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page, all related to TV shows. When one of the GIPHY images is clicked, the gif animates. If the gif is clicked again, it stops playing. Under every gif, it's rating is displayed (PG, G, etc.). The user can create new button on the page by entering the name of another TV show in the input box.
